## Welcome to my website

I am a Computer Science Graduate who is currently developing a portfolio site to show off the work I am currently undertaking and also projects I have taken during my time at University. This site is under development and I hope to launch it within the first quarter of 2021. This GitHub page will temporarily remain until the site launches. I will update this page as I get closer to the launch in 2021.
